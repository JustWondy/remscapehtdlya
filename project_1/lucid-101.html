<h1>DREAMING 1.0</h1>
<hr>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The goal of reading through LUCID 101 is the expectation that you will become a pro! 
  This textbook will educate you on the basics of what about the things you want, instead 
  it will teach you how to remember your dreams and how to formulate them.</p>

<h2>GOALS & EXPECTATIONS</h2>
<p>This is for those who have little to no dreams or those who believe they can not dream.</p>

<h2>WHY DO WE DREAM? WHAT ARE THEY?</h2>
<p>Dreams are stories or images that we see as we sleep, every species can dream. 
They are representations of our current events or the state of the subconscious, 
dreams ONLY include everything we have seen in our life whether fiction or nonfiction. In our dreams, the:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Places</li>
  <li>People</li>
  <li>Objects</l1>
  <li>Storylines</l1>
  <li>Names</li>
</ul>
<p>We have all seen these, held them, witnessed them in our life at some point. 
Some things may not be recognizable, for example, some people in our dreams do not seem recognizable because they can be a mixture of people in our lives in terms of personality or appearance. 
We dream because it is our body giving us messages about our state of living; socially, academically, mentally, emotionally, financially, spiritually, or physically. </p>

<p>Our dream tells us things that either we need to hear, what we want to hear, or what we need to realize about our lives. 
People also have dreams about their fantasies and pleasures, this document/report/journal will teach you the basics of dreaming!</p>

<h2>BEFORE THE DREAMS</h2>
<p>This is an essential part of dreaming, as the saying goes, set yourself up for success. 
  That can be applied to anything and it does not fall short in dreaming, when you are going to go to sleep make sure to keep these habits in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Always tell yourself “I am going to dream! </li> 
    <dd><b>- This will prepare your body for preparing dreams.</b></dd>
    <li>Reflect on your life. Think about your day, how it was, what you ate, think about the people in your life right now. </li>
   <dd><b>- This can set up a setting or storyline for your dream.</b></dd>
   <dd>- <b>Take some time to stay away from any electronics when you are tired.</b> </dd>
      <li>This will tell your body “Hey, I am tired, I need sleep”. Sometimes when you are drowsy it will help you get in the zone of dreaming since it will help you fall asleep faster. </li>
      <dd><b>- Watch your sleep positions. Experiment with what kind of sleeping positions make you fall asleep faster</b> </dd>
  </ul>
<p>These points will come up later in the journal as they get more advanced, retaining dreams takes time! Let's take it one step at a time </p>

<h2>AFTER THE DREAMS</h2>
<p>So when you wake up typically you feel groggy or you need to get up right away and completely forget about your dreams, here is how to slowly start retaining them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up an alarm 5 - 10 minutes earlier than you normally wake up.</li>
<dd>- We forget 30% of our dreams a minute into our day, 50% within three minutes, and 100% within five minutes</dd>
<dd>- Take the time to think about your dream, some posing questions can include:</dd>
    <li>What did I dream about?</li>
    <li>Who did I dream about?</li>
    <li>Was [Person's name, object, place] in my dream?</li>
    <li>What was the last thing I thought about last night?</li>
</ul>

<h2>DURATION OF STUDY</h2>
<p>This is a tedious part of dreaming as this is a new habit to pick up on, 
  habits can be picked up into an official routine within 48 days straight of practice. 
  Although I personally use that as a loose goal, dreaming should come naturally and happen when the body allows it. 
  The goal of dreaming overall is to understand and experience it through a natural process. </p>

<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>When following these steps and incorporating these into your everyday routine/habits, dreams will start to feel like flashbacks.</p>
<br>
<h1>DREAMING 1.1</h1>
<hr>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This next lesson will be refining your previous actions from lessons 1.0, as well as adding new habits.</p>
<h2>GOALS & EXPECTATIONS</h2>
<p>By now it is expected that you are slowly starting to memorize dreams, you have been grasping good ideas of what your dreams are like. 
  You are also catching glimpses or flashbacks of the imagery or storyline of your dreams. 
  You will learn how to control your body while your mind is at work, essentially splitting the tasks of your mind and body, when learning about your body movements will also train you for lucid dreaming. 
</p>
<h2>BEFORE THE DREAMS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reflect on your life </li>
<dd>- Think about the things that you have seen today</dd>
<dd>- Think about the videos you have watched or the sports games you have seen</dd>
<dd>- Think about the people you have talked to or seen today</dd>
<dd>- Think about the food you ate</dd>
<dd>- Think about what the sky looked like</dd>
<li>Start to do reality-checks</li>
<dd>- Look at clocks throughout the day</dd>
<dd>- There is no concept of physical time in dreams</dd>
<dd>- Clench your fists or wiggle your limbs from time to time</dd>
<dd>- In the early developments of dreaming you will not be able to feel your limbs moving in your dreams</dd>
<dd>- Always check around for mirrors in the dream</dd>
<dd>- There are no reflections in the beginning stages of dreaming</dd>
<dd>- Start to ask yourself questions:</dd>
<dd>- Am I still dreaming?</dd>
<dd>- What time is it?</dd>
<dd>- What is the date today?</dd>
<li>Watch your sleep positions</li>
<dd>- Start to subconsciously move around by slowly in your dream, the more you do this consciously the more your body will start to do it on its own.</dd>
</ul>

<h2>DURING THE DREAMS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Conduct your reality checks</li>
  <dd>- This will build muscle memory in both your dreams and your physical body</dd>
  <li>Try to look around and reach out to things</li>
  <dd>- This early in the stage you will not be able to touch things or fully interact since this is still your subconscious in control</dd>
  <dd>- The most you can do in this stage is to try and get a grasp of remembering the scenery</dd>
</ul>

<h2>AFTER THE DREAMS</h2>
<li>Set up an alarm 5 - 10 minutes earlier than you normally wake up</li>
<dd>- If you need to get up, do not rub your eyes and stay drowsy</dd>
<dd>- Keep your body on autopilot but keep thinking about your dreams</dd>

<li>Create a dream journal</li>
<dd>- Make an exclusive space to write down your dreams</dd>
<dd>- Take notes on your dreams, notate patterns or key points of dreams</dd>

<h2>DURATION OF STUDY</h2>
<p>This stage will start to roll a little faster as you are refining your skills from lesson 1.1, if you are looking for a base timeline then focus on refining these habits from 3 - 8+ weeks. You should be reminded that there is a gap between 1.1 and 1.2 since in 1.2 you are slowly picking up the process of reality-checking, which makes this stage the most tedious part of dreaming. Reality-checking takes a lot of time and control. </p>

<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>Reading lesson 1.2 and applying it to your sleeping habit, will result in you being able to control how often you dream. You might also be able to tell the kinds of people in your dream, the settings of your dream, and the storylines. Completing lesson 1.2 will also help you get into the habit of reality-checking often, making this part of your dreaming routine can also be a form of grounding during a breakdown or anxiety attack. </p>
<p>You may also start to pick up on recurring dreams during this time of dreaming, recurring dreams are a very big step in remembering dreams as this can develop a sense of pattern and habit in your subconscious.</p>

<hr>

<h1>DREAMING 1.2</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This lesson will cover the media within your dream, how much you should consume and what happens when you are influenced by the media that you consume daily. This part of the lesson will be breaking down dreams in three simple categories, the influences will affect:</p>
<li>People</li>
<li>Storyline</li>
<li>Environment</li>

<h2>GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS</h2>
<p>You are expected to know the contents of your dream, maybe not in fine detail but major keys: The people you see the most, your recurring dreams, the settings, the storylines, your state of mind or your personality within the dream. </p>

<h2>POP CULTURE CONSUMPTION</h2>
<p>Pop culture is what roams through media consumption every day whether it is through video games, movies, TV shows, comics, etc. It is a very vibrant idea and a big influence in everybody’s lives and dreams, it is something that causes our dreams to become more fiction. Consuming pop culture can develop storylines and characters in our dreams, the more you have fixated on pop-culture the more fictional your dreams you will become, you will dream up alternate universes where you can fight alongside heroes, meet a fictional character, or experience brighter dreams. </p>
<br>
<p>Yes, if you want to dream about an anime boy or anime girl you should surround yourself with media of them, this can be stretched out during the day. The ideal time to surround yourself with media is before going to bed and waking up in the morning. This can train your mind into thinking about them subconsciously as if they were a crush. Listening to their audio, watching videos, watching shows, movies, or interviews with them can influence your connection and a bond between them that could potentially show up in your dream. The more you view a fictional character as something, the more you may manifest them into your dreams. There are also possible chances that you may dream of being in their world, living out their storyline, and interacting with them.</p>

<h2>OUTDOOR CONSUMPTION</h2>
<p>Going outdoors can be a big influencer on our dreams in terms of setting, this is what sets the tone for storyline dreams. Dreams tend to start off with a blank or bleak setting, with the characters or people being barely visible. The more you go outside, and explore the world around you, the more you will help shape or merge different environments in your dream.</p>
<br>
<p>You can do this by going on a hike, going on a walk, taking a bike ride, walking to the store, taking the bus, or roaming through a nearby creek or forest. The more nature-influenced the environment is, the more realistic your dreams will become; you will be able to pick up the scents, the sounds, and the colours of a forest more. Activating your five senses by lightly studying different environments around you is the goal when looking for outdoor consumption.</p>

<h3>Social</h3>
<p>Exploring the world with a few pals or a group of ecstatic people can really heighten the experience not just for dreams but in real life, we need to remember that dreams also form through memories. Social interactions can influence a positive or a negative aspect of a dream by using memories, causing the dream to subtly communicate the relationship you have with a person. </p>

<br>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>If you want dreams that are more bizarre visit museums, look at public art pieces, go to art shows, and surround yourself with unique buildings or cool interiors. Seeing architectural projects in your dream can be a reflection of how lives are designed and how creative we are, sometimes it also shows ambition.</p>

<br>


<h2>PERSONAL CONSUMPTION</h2>
<p>When we are away from social media or from the outside world we tend to lean towards things that we do within our household, this can create a sense of spatial awareness and safety. </p>

<br>


<h3>Family</h3>
<p>You have chances of dreaming about your family if they have influenced you more in specific areas during your life, like helping you with school work or teaching you how to cook. Although sometimes dreaming about your family may not always be a happy case, sometimes dreaming about your family may indicate that you are not in the best relationship with them either, or that you have had an argument with them very recently.</p>

<br>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>Hobbies typically reflect a big part of our dreams, they can either help with the environment, with the people in your dreams, or the storyline; hobbies like playing video games can affect either attribute depending on what players focus on more.</p>

<br>

<h3>Fears</h3>
<p>Fears can manifest into our dreams quite easily, but they mostly take form through the people or the objects we see. The roots of the fears (or concerns) can often appear as the environment or buildings in our dreams, it is almost like an entirely different domain. </p>

<br>

<h3>Hopes</h3>
<p>Our hopes for our future, love life, family, friends, and career, all can affect the storyline of our dreams! It creates scenarios of challenges, concerns, accomplishments, and failures!
</p>

<h2>DURATION OF STUDY</h2>
<p>This part of the study can range from 2 weeks to a month of development.</p>

<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>When finished reading and picking up lesson 1.3, as well as incorporating the previous lessons into your dreaming habits, you will start to notice that some actions you do in reality may start to take form in your dreams. </p>

<hr>

<h1>DREAMING 1.3</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This section of the journal/study guide officially introduces the concept of lucid dreams and will help you differentiate between a regular dream and a lucid dream. Learning the difference will point you in the right direction in being able to shift normal dreams into lucid ones.</p>

<h2>GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS</h2>
<P>When picking up lesson 1.3 by now you should be able to retain the types of media you have implemented into your dreams, you should have some sort of idea or some control over your dreams, whether it would be influencing what happens beforehand or seeing more of your surroundings during these dreams. </P>

<h2>LUCID DREAMING</h2>
<p>This briefly breaks down lucid dreaming and its reasoning</p>

<h3>What is lucid dreaming?</h3>
<p>Lucid dreaming is when you become aware that you are in a dream, this could lead to you controlling your dreams. You can give yourself superpowers, you can control what you say to people and you can even change the dream entirely. </p>

<br>

<h3>How do we lucid dream?</h3>
<p>Lucid dreaming occurs the most during our REM stage, which is our most active and vivid stage the brain goes through during sleep. </p>

<br>

<h3>Why do we have lucid dreams?</h3>
<p>We tend to lucid dream because of the same reasons why we regularly dream, the reason why some people lucid dream more than others is because they have either consciously or subconsciously gone through the process of this journal. </p>

<h2>SHIFTING AND MANIFESTATION</h2>
<p>So I have been seeing a lot of shifting and manifesting on social media, it is often mixed with lucid dreaming or is quite similar to lucid dreaming. </p>

<h3>Shifting</h3>
<p>So this has been circling around social media for a while now and there are different ways to shift, sometimes it works for people easily and other times it’s difficult for people to pick up. But what is shifting anyway? Shifting is when you shift into another dimension or reality in your dream, you could be aware of the fact that you have shifted but you can not control anything in your dream but yourself. </p>

<br>

<h3>Manifestation</h3>
<p>Manifestation has also been mentioned around social media as well but can be typically seen outside of dreaming, sometimes people use manifestation to bring in good luck or for something to happen to them like good grades, or for their crush to like them back. In terms of dreaming, there is this belief that if you dream about, or believe in something very strongly that it’ll come true; and people tend to use that for characters they like. People believe that you are able to bring your character into our world, I personally do not believe in this but I will not stop other people from doing so. </p>

<h2>DURATION OF STUDY</h2>
<p>Learning to pick up lucid dreaming will take 4 - 6+ months, depending on how concentrated and committed you are to lucid dreaming. </p>

<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>When you apply lesson 1.4 to your routine you will begin to notice a bigger connection between your movement and reactions in your dreams, and you will start to develop a sense of awareness too. Everything may start to look like a simulation or feel ‘too real’, overtime your other five senses will start to develop since lucid dreaming is a big step from regular dreaming. Your control over your five senses may be loose and reckless, some dreams you may feel like you can smell things but can not taste anything, or you can feel things out but can not hear them. </p>

<hr>

<h1>DREAMING 1.4</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In lesson 1.4 you will be looking at the darker sides of learning how to dream, learning why they happen, and how to overcome them. Dreaming is not always a positive experience as it’s a stupified and extreme version of the reality we live in, you must understand that bad dreams are normal. Bad dreams can range from nightmares, or dreams that make us angry.</p>

<h2>GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS</h2>
<p>When you are reading lesson 1.5 this means that you are able to differentiate between a regular dream and a lucid dream, you also may be able to control parts or all of your dream segments at this point. If not that's okay since nightmares or sleep paralysis can happen regardless of your mental strength in dream control. The goal of this lesson is to educate yourself on the bad parts of the subconscious. </p>

<br>
<h2>SLEEP PARALYSIS</h2>
<p>I personally have never fully experienced sleep paralysis, I have a fear of it because I am a big believer of the supernatural and I am constantly paranoid. When sleep paralysis occurs your body is asleep but your mind is awake, this can cause you to feel paralyzed. People experience hallucinations that can range from seeing objects to hearing things, this can be a source of nightmare fuel since you are limited to moving your eyes (Looking around, blinking). </p>
<p>What causes sleep paralysis is:</p>
<li>Sleep deprivation</li>
<l1>Sleeping on your back</l1>
<li>Narcolepsy</li>
<li>Change in sleep schedule</li>
<l1>A full stomach</l1>
<p> To escape sleep paralysis, start by keeping your eyes closed. When your eyes are closed slowly try wiggling your toes or finger tips, it is harder to try and move your entire limb so starting small is always the best option. This also helps with distracting yourself from any noises you might hear, once you regain the feeling in your limbs hide your face or cover your eyes so that you don’t see anything; the goal is to make sure you fall back asleep and retain a positive mindset so that you don’t fall into a nightmare. Facing towards a while typically helps if your bed is placed in the corner of your room, feeling out your pillows or bedding also brings you a facade of a safe environment as well. </p>
